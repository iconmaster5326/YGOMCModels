# Yugioh Minecraft Models

This is a repository of every Yugioh monster model I've created in my quest to make one for every monster in chronological order. They're open-source, so go nuts with using them for your own purposes! I would at least humbly request credit if you do use them, however. Still, they belong to the world, not just me.

Models are available in [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/) format. Some notes on my process:

* All models are GeckoLib models; I was originally planning on using the library to add them to the game. Sadly, I do not have time to make and maintain a Minecraft mod long-term.
* The palettes I use are all sampled from the card art. You can find them as `pallette.gpl` in each folder.
* All models have one still frame animation called `idle`.
* The models in the `_OLD` folder are from before I embarked on this quest, are out of chronological order, and I give no gaurantees as their pleasentness or usability.

# Using

Download a ZIP of the repository if you just want all the models. GitHub is dumb and won't let you download individual monsters, sorry. From there, you should be able to open them all in Blockbench. They are best viewed in the "animation" tab.

# Contributing

The biggest way someone could contribute is help me make animations, add Figura support, or make a mod with these models in it. If you ever do embark on such a project, let me know!

If you want to join me in making models, watch this space. I'm not accepting model contributions yet, but that may change in the future.

# FAQ

## You're making... All of them?

Yes.

## That seems unreasonable.

Yes.

## Why are you doing a bunch of weird ones nobody cares about?

Because I'm going in strict chronological order. Also, I care about them.

## Are you going to make a Minecraft mod with all of these?

Wish I had the time. I know how to make mods, though. If anyone wants to collab, hit me up.

## Are you doing trap monsters?

Most likely yes.

## What about tokens?

Tokens don't usually have unique art, so most likely no.

## What about anime/manga/video game/etc. cards?

No. (As much as I would love to do Carat Idol.)

## Will you do (insert your favorite monster here)?

In time, I will do many things. Have patience.
